Give me a place to eat
======================

Seriously, this is a project that was created so that my husband and I can off-load the decision about where to eat to dinner to a random number generator. We tried offloading it onto the kids, but their taste is crap.

Before you ask, yes, we know about wtfsigte.com, but its algorithm doesn't take into account that we're surrounded by nine-million fast-food joints.

Eventually, I want to hook this up to an IFTTT command for my Echo, but until then, we're stuck with an aggressively plain web page.
